Algorithm:

Initialize an empty set s to store depths of special nodes.
Define a recursive function countSpecial that traverses the tree.
In countSpecial, if a leaf node is encountered and the depth is equal to k, insert the depth into set s.
Recursively call countSpecial on left and right subtrees, incrementing depth by 1 for each recursive call.
In printKDistantfromLeaf, call countSpecial to populate set s with depths of special nodes.
Recursively count special nodes in left and right subtrees and return the sum of set size s and counts from left and right subtrees.
Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
Space Complexity: O(N), for the set s.

This algorithm accurately counts the number of special nodes in the binary tree at a distance k from any leaf.
