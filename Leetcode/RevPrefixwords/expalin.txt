Intuition
The intutuion behind the problem is we have to reverse the prfixe char till the index where the first occrance of char ch is met.

Approach
1.I initalize two variables start =0 , end =-1 and check if the string is empty then return "".
2.iterate over the for loop till we find the first occurance of char ch if we find it then update end with i and break the iteration.
3.for swapping the char we use while loop till the start is less than or equal to end then swap word[start] ,ward[end] & increase the start by one and decrease the end by one.
4.return the string.

Complexity
Time complexity:
TC: O(n) for iterating over the loop n times in wrost case.

Space complexity:
SC: O(1) we don't use any extra space.
