1.Initialization:
We create a vector projects to store pairs of capital and profits.
We sort the projects based on the required capital.
2.Heap Operations:
We use a max-heap to keep track of the maximum profit we can get from the projects that can be started with the current capital.
3.Iterative Process:
For each project (up to 
𝑘
k):
Add all projects that can be started with the current capital to the max-heap.
If no projects are available to start, we break the loop.
Otherwise, we start the project with the highest profit and add its profit to the current capital.
4.Return:
The function returns the maximized capital after performing up to 
𝑘
k projects.

tC: O(N LOG N) + O(K LOG N)
SC: O(N)
