Explanation 1 code :

Initialize result string to store the first palindrome found.
Iterate through each word in the input vector.
For each word, initialize low and high indices to check for palindromes.
Use a boolean flag isPalindrome to track if the current word is a palindrome.
Check each character from both ends of the word, breaking out of the loop if characters don't match.
If the word is a palindrome, update result and exit the loop.
Return the result.
